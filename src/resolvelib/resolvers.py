        The return value is a representation to the final resolution result. It
        is a tuple subclass with three public members:

        * `mapping`: A dict of resolved candidates. Each key is an identifier
            of a requirement (as returned by the provider's `identify` method),
            and the value is the resolved candidate.
        * `graph`: A `DirectedGraph` instance representing the dependency tree.
            The vertices are keys of `mapping`, and each edge represents *why*
            a particular package is included. A special vertex `None` is
            included to represent parents of user-supplied requirements.
        * `criteria`: A dict of "criteria" that hold detailed information on
            how edges in the graph are derived. Each key is an identifier of a
            requirement, and the value is a `Criterion` instance.

        The following exceptions may be raised if a resolution cannot be found:

        * `ResolutionImpossible`: A resolution cannot be found for the given
            combination of requirements. The `causes` attribute of the
            exception is a list of (requirement, parent), giving the
            requirements that could not be satisfied.
        * `ResolutionTooDeep`: The dependency tree is too deeply nested and
            the resolver gave up. This is usually caused by a circular
            dependency, but you can try to resolve this by increasing the
            `max_rounds` argument.
