        * ``parent`` specifies the candidate that provides (depended on) the
          requirement, or ``None`` to indicate a root requirement.

        necessarily in this order):

        * Is this package pinned in the current resolution result?
        * How relaxed is the requirement? Stricter ones should probably be
          worked on first? (I don't know, actually.)
        * How many possibilities are there to satisfy this requirement? Those
          with few left should likely be worked on first, I guess?
        * Are there any known conflicts for this requirement? We should
          probably work on those with the most known conflicts.

        A sortable value should be returned (this will be used as the ``key``
        parameter of the built-in sorting function). The smaller the value is,
        the more preferred this requirement is (i.e. the sorting function
        is called with ``reverse=False``).
