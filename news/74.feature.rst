Redesign ``find_matches()`` to include resolution state on dependencies other
than the currently working one, to handle usages that need to return candidates
based on non-local states. One such example is PEP 508 direct URLs specified
on a package, which need to be available to the same package specified with
extras (which would have a different identifier).
